    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am from a small town but have big dreams. I am a young mom, but very blessed with my little one. We like to play with trains and watch shows together.</p>
        <p>I am a total nerd and geek. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. I have several years of experience working on computers starting when I would help with them in my middle school years,</p>
        <p>to getting my first and only job I've had at a local computer shop in my first year of highschool. It is such a great experience to work with others that are passionate</p>
        <p>about the same topics and hobbies as yourself. I am into anime and for a while was actually a web comic artist, so I do have digital art under my belt to help with development</p>
        <p>of programs. I am also a musician. Music is what makes my soul thrive. I play many instruments, but my favorite is the guitar (electric and acoustic). I love to sing and have</p>
        <p>actually had a few of my own gigs. Despite all of this, I know that my career is in the technology field. I've built a few hundred costum computers for customers and am great at</p>
        <p>laptop disassembly. I know the ins and outs of hardware, and my knowledge is going further into learning what software is behind it to make it all work</p>
        <br>
        <p>My ultimate goal either at the end of this course, or when I get more excelled and fluent with my skills, is to develop an interactive, 3D, realistic program model of a</p>
        <p>steam locomotive for my son. He is a huge fan of trains and of me. If I am doing this course and career for the sole purpose of skills under my belt, and not for supporting my son</p>
        <p>and giving him the best life with what I got, then what is the point. He is my pride and joy, and I hope to make him proud. I would also like to develop games and websites that are</p>
        <p>that meet needs, make life a little easier, and for the fun of it! Technology is the way our world is going, and I will not be left behind.</p>
